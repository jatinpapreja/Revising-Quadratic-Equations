# Revising-Quadratic-Equations

Given coefficients of a quadratic equation , you need to print the nature of the roots (real and distinct , real and equal , imaginary).

Input Format:
First contains three coefficients a,b,c from the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

Constraints:
-100 <= a, b, c <= 100

Output Format
Output contains one/two lines.First line contains nature of the roots .The next line contains roots separated by a space if they exist. 
If roots are imaginary do not print the roots.

Sample Input
1 -11 28

Sample Output
Real and Distinct
4 7
